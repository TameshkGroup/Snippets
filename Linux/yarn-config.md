if you install packages globally , you have to use sudo . and sudo should be avoided while installing packages. also you should have a separate directory for your global packages .

first install yarn using npm:
```
npm install -g yarn
```
now do
yarn global bin
if this returns /usr/bin , this will require sudo to install packages here . you can avoid this by changing the path.

now do:
`yarn config get prefix'
if this return '/usr'
do this:

```
mkdir ~/.yarn-global
```

this will make a hidden directory `.yarn-global` . press 'ctrl+h' to see this. now,

yarn config set prefix ~/.yarn-global
this will return /home/'username'/.yarn-global

now open your '.zshrc' or '.bashrc' using your terminal
you can type this in your terminal to open that:
subl .zshrc/.bashrc or gedit .zshrc/.bashrc

now add path of your global bin in your '.zshrc' or '.bashrc':

```
export PATH="$PATH:`yarn global bin`"
```

now save it and refresh it using:
```
source ~/.zshrc
```
now enter `yarn global bin` in your terminal
this should return:

`/home/'username'/.yarn-global/bin`

now install package globally . For instance:
```
yarn global add jest
```
there will be a binary in your bin folder in `.yarn-global` and see it didn't ask for your permission using sudo 100
now check it using:
```
jest --version
```
 and zsh and bash should return its version.
