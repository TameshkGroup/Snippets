We'll start with what's consistent and whats different between all heroes. Quite a bit of this you can find on the classic.battle.net site so I wont give values for too many things.

**Consistent among all heroes:**

- Heroes start at 100 base hit points, 0 mana points, and -2 armor.

**Different between heroes:**

- Distribution of Attributes
- Total Attribute points at level 1
- Attribute gain per level
- Base CD (attack speed)
- Base damage
- HP regen
- Pathing, i.e. collision size, turn speed, melee attack point, cast animation, after-swing, cast point, etc. (how awkward is the hero?)
- Movement Speed

------

**1 point Strength:** 25 hp, .05 hp regen per second (+1 damage for str heroes)

**1 point Agility:** 2% attack speed, .3 armor (+1 damage for agi heroes)

**1 point Intelligence:** 15 mana, .05 mana regen per second (+1 damage for int heroes)

Maybe you see it, maybe you don't, but agility is just a little bit stronger than the other 2 attributes, in the sense that it increases both damage and survivability for all heroes. Agi does 2 things, Str/Int each do 1 thing, not counting the very negligible regen. A permanent 2% damage and 2% effective hit points is a good way to look at Agi. You can also see that most heroes have a low agility and a low agility gain per level, including agility heroes (that's not to say agility would be better, as you need a certain amount of strength for agility to get value anyway). The highest Agi gain per level is the Blade Master at a depressingly low 1.75 per level (compare this to Lich's 3.4 Int per level, or 3.3 Str from Alchemist).

------

Obviously each hero has a different distribution of their attributes, but even-more, blizzard gave some heroes a lot more starting attributes than others. Another thing to note is that a few of the heroes gain more attributes per level than other heroes.

**So what is the average stat gain per level?**

- 21 of the 24 heroes all gain +6 stats per level
- Firelord gains 6.1 (gets extra .1 agi)
- Goblin Alchemist gains 6.3 (gets extra .3 str)
- Lich gains 6.4 (gets extra .4 int)

------

Remember how we said all heroes start with 100 hp, 0 mana, and -2 armor? Well, your base-ingame values are calculated based on your attributes alone, so these play a huge part in how good your hero is, because there is some disparity from the bottom to the top heroes. You need pretty good abilities to make up for bad stats, or a hero like the demon hunter or blade master will literally make the game unwinnable for you through unfair trades (on that big list I mentioned, Demon/Blade are 1 and 2 in almost every category).

**Total starting stats:** *(i.e. total str + agi + int @ level 1)*

- (49) Keeper of the Grove, Lich
- (50) Archmage, Mountain King, Tauren Chieftan
- (51) Bloodmage, Pandaren Brewmaster, Beast Master
- (52) Paladin, Far Seer, Shadow Hunter, Priestess of the Moon, Death Knight
- (53) Warden, Naga Sea Witch, Firelord, Goblin Alchemist
- (54) Crypt Lord, Dreadlord, Dark Ranger, Pit Lord
- (55) Goblin Tinker
- (57) Demon Hunter
- (58) Blade Master ("You already know who it is!" -Silentó)
- You can see that the Lich's high int gain per level is thwarted by the fact that he starts with terrible stats. The Naga, stats-wise, is better in every way. All starting stats are equal or higher, and the extra int gain that the lich gets per level is already factored into the naga at level 1, and the lich doesn't pass the naga till level 9. But blizzard was good with balance here. The lich has good damage, good attack cooldown, good collision size, and one of the strongest spells in the game, frost nova.
- Archmage, Mountain King, Tauren Chieftan are 3 of the strongest heroes in the game because their abilities are so excellent, and they take a stat hit because of it. I guess the keeper kind of makes sense to be super low, because he is strong early game, but it's unfortunate because he's not as strong as AM/MK/TC, and scales considerably worse.
- Beast Master has been heavily nerfed over the years, more-so than any other hero, so he's lower than he used to be.
- Alchemist scales well as the game goes on. He starts with 53 base attributes, and he has extra strength gain. He has such a small starting agility pool that it makes a huge difference for him to collect agility tomes, circlets, or rings of protection. It is every Alchemists deepest desire to become lord of the rings of protection.
- Goblin Tinker has very nice stats, most notably his high agility, giving him 5 starting armor. With engineering he gets more movement and damage too.
- Demon Hunter and Blade Master basically start an entire level to level and a half, stats-wise, above most other heroes. Not only this, but they have good collision, movespeed, turn speed, base CD, base damage, and stat distribution. If any heroes are the killers of innovation, it's these 2 (really), as they just trade so well early game with any other unit/hero that your opponent needs to go full strength from minute 1 to compete.

------

**Circlet of Nobility:** You might have caught on and noticed a Circlet of Nobility is pretty much the equivalent of a levels worth of stats, with probably a better distribution than you normally get (2 full agility points). If you are a level 3 hero with 2 circlets, you are essentially a level 5 hero with the abilities of a level 3 hero. So the closest you can get to tomes of power are circlets at 175 gold a piece, which is pretty good. Maybe if you want value but you don't want to break upkeep yet, it's a good place to sink gold. Also, selling a 150 gold item might be a good time to replace it with a circlet, especially on strength heroes, as they make use of their attack, hp, mana, and armor constantly in battle.

------

**Pathing:** Usually sucks to have bad pathing, but the TC has bad pathing and it can be pretty good for him (sometimes), due to stomp and blocking. But for most everyone else it sucks, especially the Alchemist/Pit Lord. Once again, the Demon Hunter/Blade Master both have extremely good pathing (turn speed, collision, attack animation, etc).

------

**Movement speed:**

- 270: All average speed heroes
- 300: Blood Mage and Pit Lord (weird, right?)
- 320: All fast heroes

------

**Base Damage:** Damage for most heroes is mostly a result of their attributes + attack CD, however 4 heroes get quite a bit of extra damage from their core make-up. Those are Demon Hunter, Warden, Blade Master, and Alchemist. Warden attacks too slow for it to matter much, but the other 3 gain obvious advantages because of it.

------

**Tomes:** *Your base hp/mana/armor is calculated entirely on stats, so every tome counts.* I hate watching streamers ignore tomes when its plainly in their face, because they think that pros don't always get them so they are just not important. Go watch a first person VOD of pro players like moon or grubby. They only miss tomes because they are hidden or their screen was never really even at the camp. But some people will literally ignore them on their screen for 20 seconds if they have to go out of their way to get them. Say you only have 18 strength and it becomes 19—thats a 5.5% permanent increase. I'm sure if a strength tome said "Your hp will be 4.5% higher than before" you would pick it up eagerly, as opposed to thinking it's just a pointless nothing item. Also, obviously agility tomes on agility heroes are completely nuts. Say TC grunts creep something and an agility + 2 drops. How far would you be willing to walk your blade to increase his damage by more than an entire level? Remember Blade only get 1.75 per level, so this makes a level 2 blade have more damage than he would have by leveling up to level 3. A tome of knowledge is a permanent half level of stats. Games are often *so* close, decided on little things. It could be micro, it could be good decision making, or it could be getting 2 extra attacks off, killing a unit quicker, and snowballing because you managed your items/tomes better.

**TLDR:**

- Blade Master, Demon Hunter, and Tinker, in that order have the highest combined starting attributes. This makes a big difference for the Blade/Demon, because they basically start at minimum a level higher than every other hero, which when combined with their good pathing, damage, and mobility, gives them very favorable trades.
- Circlets are essentially a "gain 1 level worth of stats" item. As close to a tome of power you can get, for only 175 gold.
- Never miss tomes, and give agility tomes to agility heroes even if you have to travel. Agility tome exceptions include Shadow Hunter, who has little more damage than a footman, and the Alchemist, who is a strength hero but needs agility tomes as much as a Blade Master, for both armor and speed/damage.
- I didn't really talk about it above, but 3 heroes has so much more value in pretty much every imaginable way compared to 2 heroes. The amount of stats you gain, damage, spells, ease of levels and progression, item slots, price, and creep-worth equates to enormous value as opposed to not getting a 3rd hero.
